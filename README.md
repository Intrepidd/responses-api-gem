# Typeform Responses API Gem

Welcome to the Typeform Responses API Gem! This gem provides a way of interacting with [Typeforms Responses API](https://developer.typeform.com/responses/) if you are programming in Ruby.

This gem is heavily inspired by [Typeform/create-api-gem](https://github.com/Typeform/create-api-gem).

## Getting Started

So before using the gem we recommend familiarizing yourself a little bit with our API. You can check out our [Get-Started](https://developer.typeform.com/get-started/) documentation.

You will also need a [Personal Access Token](https://developer.typeform.com/get-started/personal-access-token/) if you want to see anything you make with this gem appear in your Typeform account.

Once you have this token, we recommend for security reasons saving it as an `TYPEFORM_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Also it will save you writing some code later on, if you don't want to do this just yet it is still possible to use the gem, but as we say - it is recommended.

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'responses_api_gem', git: 'https://github.com/lhoeg/responses-api-gem.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install responses_api_gem

Wherever you use the gem, it is easiest to require it like so:

```ruby
require 'bundler'
Bundler.require
```

This should require all the gems in your Gemfile for you.

### Usage

Now we're ready to develop. Let's say you have a form, you will retrieve the last page of responses using a `RetrieveResponsesRequest`

`responses = ResponsesApi::RetrieveResponsesRequest.execute('form-id').responses` - voila!

(We use `.execute` instead of `.new` on the `RetrieveResponsesRequest` to check that we get back the correct status code)

Note: This will only work if you have set the environment variable as mentioned before. You can explicitly pass a token like this

`ResponsesApi::RetrieveResponsesRequest.execute('form-id', token: 'your-token-goes-here')`

The returned responses are sent through Hashie to simplify access. This can be disabled by adding parameter `hashie: false` to responses

`responses = ResponsesApi::RetrieveResponsesRequest.execute('form-id').responses(hashie: false)`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test" # or "spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/lhoeg/responses_api_gem. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

When writing Ruby code we use *Rubocop* as a static code analyzer. You can run `rubocop` from the route folder to make sure that your code fits the conventions we have set inside the '.rubocop.yml' file.
